# **AI in the Sports World**
Entertainment is at the heart of virtually all world cultures, but perhaps there is no country surer of that belief than the United States. People around the world are swayed by the great epics told by Hollywood, resonate with the ballads of rock icons and other musical legends, and revel in the unimaginable seeing the strongest and fastest men and women perform superhuman feats in sport. The only tantamount question about these industries is, “When will we see the next great moment?”
The advent of AI technology may help answer that question.

## Overview and Origin
While AI is quickly assisting and developing across the world in a variety of different capacities, the synergy between AI usage and sport may be one of the most exciting, if understudied, possibilities. In the National Hockey League (NHL), the rise of analytics has become a polarizing-but-revolutionary change. Where previously players were graded by the number of goals they could score, now there are new metrics to better fully understand player capacity. Off the ice, AI is assisting in allowing teams to better sell tickets and concessions, as well as assisting in broadcast technology to better reach viewers too.

One particularly intriguing recent AI development is the creation of the “NHL Edge IQ” tool by Amazon Web Services (AWS). In combination with the NHL and Sportlogiq in 2021, player and puck tracking has become automated for all 32 teams, allowing for exponentially more data collection, and by extension, providing the opportunity for analysists to better understand and predict game events.[3](https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-edge-advanced-stats-section-brings-fans-closer-to-game#:~:text=NHL.com%2FEDGE%2C%20developed,see%20where%20the%20puck%20is)
Amazon Web Services was founded in 2006 by Andy Jassey, and has worked alongside various other professional sporting leagues and teams, most notably the National Football League (NFL), the Bundesliga (the premier soccer league in Germany), and F1 Racing.

In 2001, the NHL and AWS agreed to a partnership whereby Amazon would become the “Official Cloud, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning Infrastructure Partner” of the NHL. According to the official press release, the NHL aims to utilize the infrastructure of AWS in conjunction with tracking technology (both Amazon’s Kinesis system and the NHL’s ‘Hockey Information and Tracking System’). Additionally, AWS will be able to assist with experimental production and broadcasting technology. According to the official press release:
>The NHL will work with the Amazon Machine Learning Solutions Lab to apply AWS’s deep portfolio of machine learning services to game video and official NHL data – including data from the NHL’s new Puck and Player Tracking (PPT) System and from the NHL’s Hockey Information & Tracking System (HITS) real-time stats – to develop and share advanced game analytics and metrics that take fans deeper into the game. In addition, the NHL intends to use AWS Elemental Media Services to develop and manage a cloud-based HD and 4K video content delivery system that will provide a complete view of the game to NHL officials, coaches, players, and fans. Powered by AWS, the system will encode, process, store, and transmit game footage from a series of new camera angles to provide continuous video feeds that capture plays and events outside the field of view of traditional broadcast cameras. In addition, by leveraging AWS analytics services including Amazon Kinesis (AWS’s service for easily collecting, processing, and analyzing video and data streams in real time) and machine learning services such as Amazon SageMaker (AWS’s service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly), the NHL will be able to audit its feeds to broadcast partners in real time. This capability will enable the NHL to create a smart monitoring system that detects and automatically fixes potential feed issues, offering fans a seamless in-game experience across viewing platforms.

While details about the specific financial agreements of the partnership are not easily accessible, Amazon has been given the rights to produce NHL-related content on their platform, starting with “All or Nothing: Toronto Maple Leafs” in 2021 and most recently “Faceoff: Inside the NHL” in October this year.[7](https://www.nhl.com/news/faceoff-inside-the-nhl-to-launch-on-prime-video-on-oct-4-2024) Additionally, Amazon will become an official broadcaster of NHL games on their streaming platform (Amazon Prime Video) starting in Canada next year. The valuation of those broadcasts is predicted to be worth about $3.52 million CAD (Canadian dollars) per game, or $91.5 million CAD for each of their two acquired seasons.[8](https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/its-latest-nhl-deal-shows-how-amazon-prime-is-now-investing-in-sports-rights)

## Business Activities and Landscape
In 2021, the partnership between the NHL and AWS began. Within a year, they had developed a program that could predict the odds of any two players winning a face-off against one another, aptly called “Face-off Probability.”[9](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/nhl-unveils-first-ai-powered-stat-to-predict-face-off-winner-before-puck-is-dropped) [10](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/face-off-probability-part-of-nhl-edge-iq-predicting-face-off-winners-in-real-time-during-televised-games/)
Within the next three years, they have developed player and puck tracking metrics that far outstripped anything prior to the partnership, as well as analytics predicting the odds that any shot becomes a goal, in-game momentum trackers, and save percentage odds. This is all in addition to the off-ice achievements in broadcasting.[11](https://aws.amazon.com/sports/nhl/)
While the services provided by AWS are publicly available, they are primarily utilized by all 32 NHL teams, the league itself, and NHL stakeholders. The data itself is collected via the NHL EDGE puck and player tracking technology, relayed to AWS with 3600 data points per second, and then combined with AWS’ “Kinesis” system (and various others) that can analyze these data points and convey real time assessments like the “Ice Tilt” assessment examines game flow and momentum.[12](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/aws-and-nhl-unveil-new-ice-tilt-stat-to-measure-team-momentum-during-the-game/)
While other analysts exist in the industry such as Sportradar, Drive Hockey Analytics, Catapult Sports, and various independent enthusiasts, none have the near-immediate predictive capacity of AWS powered by their significant infrastructure.

## Results and Recommendations
As with the difficulty in uncovering financial details of the partnership, public metrics for success seem to be varied and possibly even experimental. AWS lists on their website three goals for the partnership: more data analysis, fan engagement, and enhancing broadcast potential.[13](https://aws.amazon.com/sports/nhl/)
By those metrics, the partnership is already a glowing success. Undoubtedly there is financial appeal to expanding to more markets as a result of the partnership, as well as mass customer appeal as fans become more familiar with AWS’ products. Raw data collected from the NHL’s tracking technology is also assuredly valuable in some capacity as well, likely for marketing purposes for other products that can be mass retailed via Amazon and partners. Undoubtedly though, whatever financial incentive AWS is searching for, it seems to remain an extremely lucrative offering considering their increasing presence in the NHL sphere.
Going forward, the only way still seems to be up for the partnership. AWS will likely keep finding ways to analyze data for pivotal game impacts, and the only way to do that is more data, in whatever capacity that is. One model for improvement may be the juggernaut of sports analytics: Major League Baseball (MLB). MLB analysts can record incredible data, such as rotation speed on pitches, launch angle on home runs, and various other metrics that no other professional league can rival. For example, while the puck may have a tracker located inside, players’ sticks do not, and measuring stick movement could provide a similar boon like launch angle did for baseball. Ultimately, teams want more data, in whatever form it can help them get a leg up on the competition.[14](https://youtu.be/L4w5-dV2HbM?t=829)
It may be as simple as more trackers in gear, but opportunity cost and the possible affect on players may make future changes more difficult. The technology is already in use, it’s simply a matter of whether the NHL and AWS are willing to go further down this route in the quest for predictive data.
